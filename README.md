# BLOG SERVER (back-end)
This is the back-end of a Blog app. Features include:
- Receive blog requests from front-end, handle requests, and respond with suitable code and contents
- Handle user authentication and make sure only authorized owner of a blog can modify that blog. Allow to create new users
- Keep data in a server database (MongoDB)

## To config:
Add these 4 suitable environment variables in your case 

1. ``MONGODB_URI`` database link, something like this `mongodb+srv://[username]:[password]@cluster0-jcavg.mongodb.net/bloglist?retryWrites=true`
2. ``MONGODB_URI_TEST`` similar database but for testing purpose
3. ``PORT`` port for running server locally
4. ``SECRET`` any string to add into the authentication

## To start:
``npm install`` install dependencies

``npm start`` run in Production mode

## To run in development mode
``npm run dev`` run in Development mode (with `nodemon`)

## To run test for development purpose (jest environment)
``npm test`` run the whole test
``npm test -- -t TESTCODE`` run individual test based on TESTCODE (which are bold below)
sample requests are placed under the `requests` folder
